# NestJS Monorepo Backend Configured with Turborepo

A template for almost everything you need to start a new monorepo backend project in NestJS, excepting engaging with RDBMS databases because the author (me) has no experience working with them in TypeScript.

I also highly recommend applying CQRS, which is supported out-of-the-box by NestJS. See [NestJS CQRS](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/cqrs).
